# Data-Pagination-and-Filtering
 
Utilized "pagination" to enhance usability of web page.

Started with file containing information of 42 students, including name, email, and picture. Used Javascript to display first nine students on page. Them added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that allows user to click and display different pages of students.

Application works with a list of any number of students. Solutions provided are flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths.
